# Total Time Consumption
Total Time consumption is a site were you can track, how little activities add up over a longer period of time. 

I made it for a project for Hackclub and the idea came from when I was wondering how 30min a day doom scrolling adds up. It doesn't seem like much at once but over 1 year thats more than a week of straight scrolling.

## Overview/Features
At the top theres a text field to enter the activity, although its not needed you can just leave it open. Under that theres 3 sliders, the first for how long each day in minutes, the second is for days per week, so how often a week and the third I put there so you can see how much time it is over a set amount of years. 
At the bottom then is the result were you can see how long it is over a week, a year and then the set time

## Technology
I used 
- HTML for the structure
- CSS for making it look better
- JS for calculation etc.

of course is run on browser.

## How to run
1. Download the repo
2. open the index.html in a browser (modern browser)

Or of course over the link:
